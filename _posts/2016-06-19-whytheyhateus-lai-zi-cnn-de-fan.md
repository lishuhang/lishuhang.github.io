CNN 主持人扎卡利亚（Fareed Zakaria）可能是最适合主持和 ISIS 有关的栏目的人选了。他出生在印度的一个穆斯林家庭，他2015年10月也重申了自己是穆斯林，但是是“世俗的”和“消极被动的”（Zakaria is a self-described secular and non-practicing Muslim）。当时他说：

> “我对宗教的认识很复杂，介于自然神论和不可知论之间。在观念上我是完全世俗的。”（My views on faith are complicated — somewhere between deism and agnosticism. I am completely secular in my outlook.）

今天早上（美国时间周六晚上黄金时间）CNN连续播出两集专题节目：《为什么他们恨我们》（#whytheyhateus）和《奇袭：伊斯兰国如何震撼世界》（ISIS: #blindsided）。第二集现在还在播，我没顾上看。

主要的，我想复述一下扎卡利亚在《为什么他们恨我们》结尾的陈辞：

> The next time you hear of a terror attack -- no matter where it is, no matter what the circumstances -- you will likely think to yourself, "It's Muslims again." And you will probably be right.下次你听说一个恐怖袭击发生——不管在什么地方，不管什么场合——你很可能会私下想“这又是穆斯林干的”。而很有可能，你说的对。In 2014, about 30,000 people were killed in terror attacks worldwide. The vast majority of those perpetrating the violence were Muslim but -- and this is important -- so were the victims. Of the some 30,000 dead, the vast, vast majority were Muslims.在2014年，全世界范围内有大约3万人死于恐怖袭击。其中绝大多数实施暴力的是穆斯林。但是——以下这个事实很重要——受害者也是如此。在大概3万名死者当中，绝大多数，绝大多数都是穆斯林。That's crucial to understand because it sheds light on the question, "Why do they hate us?" Islamic terrorists don't just hate America or the West. They hate the modern world, and they particularly hate Muslims who are trying to live in the modern world.这对于理解问题很关键，因为它投向一个问题，“为什么他们恨我们？”伊斯兰教恐怖分子不只是憎恨美国或者憎恨西方。他们憎恨整个当代世界，而他们尤其憎恨那些试图存活于现代社会的穆斯林。Let's be clear. While the jihadis are few, there is a larger cancer within the world of Islam -- a cancer of backwardness and extremism and intolerance. Most of the countries that have laws that restrict the free exercise of religion are Muslim majority, while those that have laws against leaving the faith are Muslim majority.让我们打开天窗说亮话。虽然极端圣战分子是少数，而整个伊斯兰世界流传着更广泛的癌症——向极端主义，向不容忍倒退的癌症。穆斯林主流情形就是国家严格执行教法，有专门的法律来针对叛教者。But are these things inherent in the religion?但是这些事情是否都是这个宗教骨子里面的东西呢？When experts try to explain that in the 14th century, Islamic civilization was the world's most advanced, or that the Quran was once read as a liberal and progressive document, they're not trying to deny the realities of backwardness today. What they are saying is that it can change.学者们试图解释在14世纪伊斯兰文明是世界上最发达的，或者《古兰经》一度被视为带有解放和进步意义的文献。这时，他们不是试图矢口否认这一宗教现在的倒行逆施，他们所说的是，这一切都可以改变。Islam, after all, has been around for 14 centuries. There have been periods of war and of peace. Before 1900, for hundreds of years, Jews fled European pogroms and persecution to live in relative peace and security under the Ottoman Caliphate. That's why there were a million Jews in the Muslim Middle East in 1900. Today, Jews and Christians are fleeing from Iraq and Syria and radical Islamists take control of those lands. It's the same religion then and now. So what is different?伊斯兰教，归根结底，是已经存在了14个世纪的。这漫长的时光中有战争，有和平。在1900年以前几百年的时间，犹太人在欧洲人民的集体迫害之下，必须生活在奥斯曼帝国的保护之中，享受到相对的和平与安全。这就是为什么在1900年代，在穆斯林统治的中东有100多万犹太人。现在，犹太人和基督徒从伊拉克和叙利亚逃离，伊斯兰教极端分子正控制这些地区。当时和现在宗教是一样的，那什么东西不一样了？It's not theology, it's politics. Radical Islam is the product of the broken politics and stagnant economics of Muslim countries. They have found in radical religion an ideology that lets them rail against the modern world, an ideology that is now being exported to alienated young Muslims everywhere -- in Europe, and even in some rare cases in the United States.不是宗教理论变了，是政治局势变了。极端伊斯兰是穆斯林国家破碎的政治现状和不景气的经济现状的综合产物。他们在极端宗教中发现了让他们足以对抗整个现代社会的一个意识形态，这一意识形态现在正缓缓外流，让世界各地的年轻穆斯林脱离社会——在欧洲，甚至于极其罕见的发生在美国的案例当中。How can we bring an end to this?怎么结束这一切？There's really only one way: Help the majority of Muslims fight extremists, reform their faith, and modernize their societies. In doing so, we should listen to those on the front lines, many of whom are fighting and dying in the struggle against jihadis. The hundreds of Muslim reformers I've spoken to say their task is made much harder when Western politicians and pundits condemn Islam entirely, demean their faith, and speak of all Muslims as backward and suspect.确实只有一条路可走，就是帮助穆斯林当中的大多数与极端主义作战，重组他们的信仰，把他们带入现代社会。为了这样做，我们理应听到那些来自前线的声音，很多人都是在顽强的跟这些极端主义者战斗，甚至死于他们的手中。我曾经跟数以百计的伊斯兰教宗教改革家谈话，他们说，特别是因为西方政客和评论员在不分青红皂白地控诉整个伊斯兰群体，羞辱他们的信仰，表示所有穆斯林都是倒退和有犯罪嫌疑的，这让他们的工作尤为艰难。But here's another way to think about this. In America, African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, yet they comprise about 50% of homicide offenders, according to a Justice Department study. Now we understand -- I hope we understand -- that when we see a black man on the street, we cannot and must not treat him as a likely criminal. It would be dehumanizing, unfair and racist. In America, of all places, people should be treated as individuals and not as stereotypes from a racial, ethnic or religious group. And remember, the Bangladeshi cabdriver who drives you to the airport has nothing, nothing to do with ISIS, even though he is also a Muslim.然而这里有另外一条路来思考这个问题。在美国，非裔占人口的13%，而根据司法部的研究结论，他们实施了50%的谋杀案。现在我们明白了——我希望我们明白——现在看到一个黑人走在大街上的时候，我们不应该，而且绝不能把他当做一个嫌犯，这是不人道的，不公平的，种族主义的。在美国，在所有地方，人都应该被视为一个个体，而不应该是戴上种族，民族或者宗教的大帽子。而且请记住，那些带你去机场的孟加拉裔出租车司机，他们跟伊斯兰国毫无关系，毫无关系，尽管他也是穆斯林。Of course, it is hard not to make these quick associations -- especially in the wake of a terror attack. But if America is about anything, it is the idea that people should be judged as individuals with individual liberties and rights. It is what they hate about us. We might as well live up to our own ideals.当然，我们要想避免下意识的关联是很困难的，特别是在恐怖袭击的阴影之下。但是如果美国就是我们的一切所有，那么人就应该被作为个体来评判，就应该拥有个体的自由和权利。这就是为什么他们恨我们。我们必须依着我们自己的理想而生活下去。

The next time you hear of a terror attack -- no matter where it is, no matter what the circumstances -- you will likely think to yourself, "It's Muslims again." And you will probably be right.

下次你听说一个恐怖袭击发生——不管在什么地方，不管什么场合——你很可能会私下想“这又是穆斯林干的”。而很有可能，你说的对。
